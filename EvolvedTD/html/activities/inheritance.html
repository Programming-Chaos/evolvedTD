        <span>
            <p>We are creating a lesson plan targeted toward middle-school students to study the effects of inheritance. We will modify the code such that each creature has only one color (not a color per segment), and selecting a creature will display its identifier, color value, and the color value and identifier of each of its parents. The students will be instructed to count the number of creatures in each color group (red, green, and blue) at the beginning of each generation.<br/>
                <br/>Each student will choose a particular color group, and record the identifiers and parents of each creature in that group. The students will then place a turret (with infinite money) and manually attempt to eliminate all creatures that are not of their chosen color, allowing their chosen creatures to survive. With each generation, they will recount the number of creatures in each color group, and record the identifiers and parents of their chosen group of creatures.<br/>
                <br/>At the end of several waves, the students will analyze their collected data and use a provided worksheet to create a pedigree of the creatures from their chosen color group. After creating the pedigree, the students will be asked to draw conclusions about the inheritance (or lack thereof) that they observed in the populations.</p>
