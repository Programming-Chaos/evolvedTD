        <h2>Explanation of Experiment</h2>
        <span>
            <p>The idea that an environment can effect the traits of an organism is not a new idea, but it quickly can become complicated when you start to consider other organisms as part of that environment. Within our game there can be determined 2 organisms that exist, you and your team of fellow miners, and that of the Protean Swarm.<br/>
                <br/>This educational activity looks at investigating how a player selecting to target specific traits such as width can affect the average value of traits within that population over time.</p>
