            <h2>Meet Chuck!</h2>
            <span><img id="chuck" src="images/chuck.png" align="left"/>
                <p>Chuck, known as Charles to his ships AI, is at the forefront of deep space mining operations. The Nomurai is home to his small mining crew and many others that have opted to go deeper into space than any other has gone before. Brave Charles embarks on solo gathering missions over an array of different worlds, unaware of what may be waiting for him on the surface. <img id="chuck-helmet" src="images/chuck-helmet.png" align="right"/><br/>
                    <br/>With his crew back on the Nomurai and the resources collected from his biomats, Charles is well equipped to face anything these worlds can throw at him. Focused on his mission he set out in his drop ship, ever determined and ready for what lies ahead.</p>

            <span><img id="nomurai" src="images/nomurai.png" align="left"/>
                <p>Named for their distinctive shape and relatively low top speed, Cnidaria Class ships have the Capacity to shelter 200+ crew members. Many Cnidarian crews include, but are not limited to, mining teams, mechanics, biological researchers, Physicists and Engineers. These mobile platforms find their way into many deep space missions and are often noted as being small mobile cities. <br/>
                    <br/>Besides its large cargo hold, a key reason Cnidarian class ships are favored by deep space mining operations is their capacity for building and their mechanical engineering space. They are mainly used as a launching platform and repair depot in deep space missions.</p>

            <h2>The SolarWin Corporation</h2>
            <span><img id="solarWin" src="images/solarWin.png" align="left"/>
                <p>Faster than light travel brought about colonization of the stars and business opportunities for countless industries. The SolarWin Corporation was founded on the idea that affordable clean energy can bring Prosperity to the galaxy. After years of development a new source was found: BIOMAT.  <br/>
                    <br/><img id="biomat" src="images/biomat.png" align="right"/>The BIOMAT is a system that utilizes photosynthetic biomatter to harness the ambient radiation from its surroundings. This maximizes energy production to a level not found in nature. Solar, thermal, and weather systems all power the BIOMAT system. The BIOMAT system can function in a variety of environments and conditions. <br/>
                    <br/><img id="nebula" src="images/nebula.png" align="right"/>Unrestricted by energy limitations, humanity can push deeper into space. First by the explorers and followed close after by commercial enterprises. SolarWin Corporation's scientists have discovered a nebula in a relatively unexplored section of the cosmos. The Nomurai has been dispatched by the SolarWin Corporation to study the nebula's budding planets. Armed with a crack research team, this deep space mission will be a harrowing venture for the crew of the Nomurai. <br/>

            <h2>The Red Hook "Galapagos" Nebula</h2>
            <span><img id="redhook" src="images/redhook.png" align="left"/>
                <p>The Red Hook Nebula is a birthing place for small inhabited planets. These planets are scattered across a dense cluster of star systems and creates a large Variety of ecological systems and landscapes. <br/>
                    <br/>The name Galapagos Nebula as its locally called, came about because of the inhabitance of these strange planets. Creatures of similar descendants seem to spring up on most of the planets in the nebula. Separated by vast amounts of space they each evolve in their own way creating a unique system of life unseen elsewhere in the universe.</p>
