        <h2>Overview of Brain and Behavior</h2>
        <span>
            <p>When we think about an organism interacting with its environment or behaving a certain way, typically we think about organisms that have a brain. However, a brain is not required in order to sense and react to the environment. Every living thing, from a single celled organism all the way up to a giant tree has some means to respond to its environment. Plants can tell when they are being eaten by caterpillars [http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a11550/plants-can-hear-themselves-being-eaten-and-they-dont-like-it-17337795/] Appel, H. (2014). Plants respond to leaf vibrations caused by insect herbivore chewing. Oecologia, (4), 1257-1266. [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-014-2995-6], but not having a brain keeps them from doing much more than releasing chemicals to discourage the tiny diner. They can't figure out which leaf the caterpillar is munching on, and they can't wildly flail a branch in the hopes of shaking the caterpillar off. </p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Brain and Behavior</h2>
        <h4>Biology Overview</h4>
        <span>
            <p><p>Having a brain will usually allow an organism to react to its environment in interesting or sophisticated ways. Because the caterpillar has a brain, if the plant it has been happily feasting on releases nasty chemicals, the caterpillar can choose to eat somewhere else until the plant stops releasing those chemicals. Similarly, because the individual members of the Protean Swarm will each have a brain, as the game progresses and the Swarm population evolves, they will be exhibiting more complex behaviors than just eating and reproducing. </p>
            <p>Terminology </p>
            <p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of brain functioning, these are some terms you should be familiar with:</p>
            <p>*Neuron: A single brain cell capable of responding to an electrical signal from, or generating an electrical signal for other neurons as a means of calculating and communicating. </p>
            <p>*Stimulus: Something in the environment that an organism may or may not perceive depending on its ability to sense the thing, e.g. photons or mechanical pressures or chemicals. </p>
            <p>*Sensation: Information from the environment that an organism's sensory system detects and passes to the brain to be dealt with, e.g. light or touch or taste. </p>
            <p>*Perception: What the brain interprets the information from the sensory systems to be, e.g. the sun or a rock or a strawberry. </p>
            <p>For the portion of the game dealing specifically with the Protean brain and Protean behavior, we will use the following definitions: </p>
            <p>*Environment: The physical space the creatures inhabit and everything it contains; the world of EvolveTD. </p>
            <p>*Brain: The portion of the code that takes inputs from the sensory system and creates behaviors; whether the behavior is appropriate to the situation will depend entirely on the genome. </p>
            <p>*Behavior: Any number of actions that the species evolves by sensing and responding to stimuli in its environment; not all behaviors will necessarily be displayed by all members of the species. </p>
            <p>*Instinct: A biological drive that directs the creature to engage in activities that allow it to reproduce at some point in its life. </p>
            <p>*Input: Any stimulus the creature has the potential to sense, regardless of whether it has the capabilities of incorporating the information the stimulus provides. </p>
            <p>*Output: Refers to an electrical pulse generated by a neuron as a means of communicating to other neurons; distinct from ''Behavior''. </p>

        <h4>Biology of the Brain and Behavior</h4>
        <span>
            <p>[[File:Three neurons.jpg|Three neurons might be connected like this(Carlson, N. R. (2009). ''Physiology of Behavior''. (10th ed.). Pearson). The arrows show which direction information flows.] </p>
            <p>Your brain is made up of a bunch of cells called neurons. The outside "skin," or cell membrane, of these and other cells are made up of fat molecules. The three main parts of neurons are the cell body ('''soma'''), the information receiving end ('''dendrite'''), and the information transmission end ('''axon'''). At the end of the axon there is a structure called the '''terminal button'''. Within the terminal button there are a bunch of little bubbles made of the same fat molecules that make up the cell membrane. Each bubble, called a '''vesicle''', can be thought of as a flexible, fluid-filled envelope containing different chemical messengers ('''neurotransmitters''') that get released into the fantastically tiny space between two neurons ('''synapse'''), or into the next neuron itself. There are several different neurotransmitters, but they all either encourage a neuron to '''fire''', or pass an electrical charge to other neurons ('''excitatory'''), or discourage the neuron from firing ('''inhibitory'''), thus keeping it from directly transmitting information. </p>
            <p>[[File:Terminal button.jpg|A closeup of the terminal button of one neuron, filled with vesicles, next to the dendrite of another ("Carlson").] </p>
            <p>This is how the individual parts of the brain talk to themselves and each other in order to determine what information it is receiving and how it relates together so it can figure out how to react to the sticky situation you've gotten yourself into. However, in order for your reaction to be appropriate to the circumstances, the brain has to have some way to take in information from the environment so it can decide what the appropriate reaction is. It does this through the organism's sensory systems, like smell, touch, taste, hearing, and vision. The brain listens to every part of the body it belongs to in order to figure out how to react without making you trip over a tree root or get caught in a rosebush. The brain also talks to every part of the body in order to give the body instructions about what changes need to be made in order to react. </p>
            <p>Your eyes tell your brain what light they detect. Your sense of touch tells your brain when your body has bumped into something and what it feels like. Your ears tell your brain what sound frequencies are present, and help locate where the sound came from. If you lick something, your tongue will tell your brain what chemical compounds it has picked up. Your nose will tell your brain what chemical compounds are in the air, and how many of them are in a certain area. This all happens at once, and combines to create a distinct recognition of something from your environment such as a food item or another organism. </p>
            <p>Each kind of creature has developed differently over time, which is why your sense of smell is not the same as a dog's sense of smell. Vision is more important to humans than it is to most animals, which is why we can see our environment with more detail and in more colors than dogs can, but dogs have a better sense of smell than we do (Singh, S. 2007). Each kind of organism, over many, many generations spanning millions of years, has evolved their own distinct combination of senses and sense strengths, and their brains reflect this (Winowgrad, T., & Flores, F. 1987). Understanding Computers and Cognition: A new foundation for design. Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corp. Humans and their evolutionary relatives [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae] have evolved a bigger frontal lobe than other animals (Fuster, J. M. 2002). Frontal lobe and cognitive development. Journal of neurocytology, 31(3-5), 373-385. See http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024190429920. The frontal lobe contributes to our ability to use tools, problem-solve, and come up with novel ways of interacting with our environment. The way your brain works is also influenced by what you do frequently. If you text frequently, you will have more connections in the portion of your brain that deals with thumb movement, and those connections will be stronger than they would be in someone who has never texted in their life. </p>

        <h2>Simplifying Assumptions</h2>
         <p>We have made the brain model within EvolveTD very simple, making sure the maximum number of neurons is very limited. The members of the Protean Swarm have 100 neurons each, which is a fraction of a fraction of the number of neurons in biological brains.  There are also currently three outputs from the brain. </p>
            <p>Additionally, because we are using a feedforward artificial neural network [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network], information can only move from the inputs to the outputs. There is no way for the creatures to modify their behavior based on previous experiences. In other words, the individual creatures do not learn [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation]. Instead, as the population evolves, those that survive to reproduce pass along slightly different versions of their behaviors to their offspring. </p>
