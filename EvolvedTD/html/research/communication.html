        <h2>Overview of Communication</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Since the beginning of our existence, the human race has used many methods to communicate. These actions could be movement, sound, or even writing on paper.  Communication [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication] is when the actions of one creature affect the actions of another, through the exchange of information between each group.  Many early forms of communication were as simple as writing or drawing on walls, and as time progressed, communication branched out into language and the use of symbols.  Forms of communication such as the use of fires to generate smoke to be used as signals are also good examples of a desire to communicate beyond our own physical boundaries. </p> 
            <p>On a daily basis, we each use multiple forms of communication such as: speaking to someone, writing an email, or using a turn signal as we’re driving. We also use indirect methods to communicate, and of of those methods is through visual communication [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908003222].  An example of this would be the male puffin displaying bright rings on his beak only during mating season.  Another type of indirect communication is that of scent, and an example would be female ants secreting chemical factors called pheromones [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aty3hz6rdlgC&oi=fnd&pg=PP15&dq=communication+animal+review&ots=nZTk8j0jMQ&sig=hRKUbX1uZaJOUQdTV9cGD0ckils#v=onepage&q=communication%20animal%20review&f=false] to attract mates. </p>
            <p>So, you ask, why is communication an essential part of EvolveTD? The ability to communicate gives the creatures an avenue in which to learn from its surroundings through recognition and response to those elements. In order to make sense biologically, communication skills must be developed gradually over a period of time. Think of it this way, when you were an infant, you learned to talk over a period of many months. When you got older, you didn’t learn to ride a bike, drive a car, or even text a message on your cell phone in one brief moment. You had to develop these skills through a pattern of recognition, response and repetition. Even in regard to mating, effective communication skills must be developed in order to attract a mate, reproduce and keep the offspring safe. Development of these skills is crucial to survival, and without them, creatures would be severely stunted in their ability to evolve effectively enough to continue surviving throughout the generations. To determine how well the creatures can communicate in EvolveTD, a simple model based on the nature of the signal [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fUFLKFbvt0gC&oi=fnd&pg=PR13&dq=communication+animal+review&ots=qheM3To8aL&sig=_vhFMFc7chgrbB4mSWwFT4n0j2c#v=onepage&q=communication%20animal%20review&f=false] emitted by the creature doing the action and the nature of the response signal emitted by the creature receiving the action can be used. </p>

        <h4>Evolved vs Learned Communication</h4>
        <span>
            <p>[http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/258a/learning_and_evolution_nolfi_floreano.pdf]
Evolved Communication is the process of selective reproduction and substitution based on the existence of a specific population of individuals displaying some variability.  Evolution captures the slow environmental changes of the game that, over time, affect the ability of the creatures to communicate. </p>
            <p>Learned Communication is the set of changes or modifications taking place within each single individual during its own lifetime.  Learning gives individuals the ability to react and adapt to sudden environmental changes. </p>
            <p>Over time, the creatures have the capacity to evolve communication in the population through changes in their genotype [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype], genetic changes from generation to generation, as well as to learn individually as shown by changes to their phenotype [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype], or change in observable characteristics or traits within a generation. If the creatures choose to utilize the evolution and/or learned pathways, the biology of the creatures will continue to become more and more diverse both within each wave of attack and throughout the game as a whole. </p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Communication</h2>
        <h4>Scent</h4>
        <span>
            <p>The sense of smell is developed when sensory cells from the nose send messages to the brain. These cells are known as sensory neurons.  Odors emitted by the objects and people around us release microscopic molecules that stimulate the odor receptor for each olfactory sensory neuron. For instance, if you are in a coffee shop, the neurons from your olfactory receptors would detect the molecules projected through the coffee's aroma. Because there are more aromas than receptors, it is possible that a combination of receptors would be used to correctly identify the scent. As soon as the brain registers the smell, that information is stored for later usage and is retrieved when encountered again. </p>
            <p>Currently, the communication team has created two scents in EvolveTD: food and creature. Each scent is coded separately from each other, because biologically, there would be two separate channels of olfactory sensory neuron combinations to identify either the scent of food or scent of the creature. By taking advantage of the biological phenomenon of smell, the creatures in EvolveTD will be able to recognize each other by the individual scent that they emit. </p>
