        <h2>Overview of Communication</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Since the beginning of our existence, the human race has used many methods to communicate. These actions could be movement, sound, or even writing on paper.  Communication is when the actions of one creature affect the actions of another, through the exchange of information between each group.  Many early forms of communication were as simple as writing or drawing on walls, and as time progressed, communication branched out into language and the use of symbols.  Forms of communication such as the use of fires to generate smoke to be used as signals are also good examples of a desire to communicate beyond our own physical boundaries. <br/> 
                <br/>On a daily basis, we each use multiple forms of communication such as: speaking to someone, writing an email, or using a turn signal as we’re driving. We also use indirect methods to communicate, and of of those methods is through visual communication.  An example of this would be the male puffin displaying bright rings on his beak only during mating season.  Another type of indirect communication is that of scent, and an example would be female ants secreting chemical factors called pheromones to attract mates. <br/>
                <br/>So, you ask, why is communication an essential part of EvolveTD? The ability to communicate gives the creatures an avenue in which to learn from its surroundings through recognition and response to those elements. In order to make sense biologically, communication skills must be developed gradually over a period of time. Think of it this way, when you were an infant, you learned to talk over a period of many months. When you got older, you didn’t learn to ride a bike, drive a car, or even send a text in one brief moment. You had to develop these skills through a pattern of recognition, response and repetition. Even in regard to mating, effective communication skills must be developed in order to attract a mate, reproduce and keep the offspring safe.<br/>
                <br/>Development of these skills is crucial to survival, and without them, creatures would be severely stunted in their ability to evolve effectively enough to continue surviving throughout the generations. To determine how well the creatures can communicate in EvolveTD, a simple model based on the nature of the signal emitted by the creature doing the action and the nature of the response signal emitted by the creature receiving the action can be used. </p>

        <h4>Evolved vs Learned Communication</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Evolved Communication is the process of selective reproduction and substitution based on the existence of a specific population of individuals displaying some variability.  Evolution captures the slow environmental changes of the game that, over time, affect the ability of the creatures to communicate. <br/>
                <br/>Learned Communication is the set of changes or modifications taking place within each single individual during its own lifetime.  Learning gives individuals the ability to react and adapt to sudden environmental changes. <br/>
                <br/>Over time, the creatures have the capacity to evolve communication in the population through changes in their genotype, genetic changes from generation to generation, as well as to learn individually as shown by changes to their phenotype, or change in observable characteristics or traits within a generation. If the creatures choose to utilize the evolution and/or learned pathways, the biology of the creatures will continue to become more and more diverse both within each wave of attack and throughout the game as a whole. </p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Communication</h2>
        <h4>Scent</h4>
        <span>
            <p>The sense of smell is developed when sensory cells from the nose send messages to the brain. These cells are known as sensory neurons.  Odors emitted by the objects and people around us release microscopic molecules that stimulate the odor receptor for each olfactory sensory neuron. For instance, if you are in a coffee shop, the neurons from your olfactory receptors would detect the molecules projected through the coffee's aroma. Because there are more aromas than receptors, it is possible that a combination of receptors would be used to correctly identify the scent. As soon as the brain registers the smell, that information is stored for later usage and is retrieved when encountered again. <br/>
                <br/>Currently, the communication team has created two scents in EvolveTD: food and creature. Each scent is coded separately from each other, because biologically, there would be two separate channels of olfactory sensory neuron combinations to identify either the scent of food or scent of the creature. By taking advantage of the biological phenomenon of smell, the creatures in EvolveTD will be able to recognize each other by the individual scent that they emit. </p>

        <h2>Computational Model of Metabolism</h2>
        <h4>Communication Framework</h4>
        <span>
            <p>The transmitting creature maps its current internal state to actions. This is called encoding. Similarly the receiving creature maps the transmitting creatures actions to changes in its own current internal state by decoding. This means there are two translations happening in communication. Between those two translations and other factors such as distance, ability to recognize actions as communication, or misreading actions as communication, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Removing these errors can be done in four ways:<br/><br/>
                <li class="list"><b>Redundancy:</b> multiple actions to communicate the same internal state.</li>
                <li class="list"><b>Conspicuousness:</b> actions that distinguish themselves from the background of actions the receiver must decode.</li>
                <li class="list"><b>Small repertoires:</b> Having a small number of actions makes it easier for the receiver to decode, because there are less actions to misinterpret.</li>
                <li class="list"><b>Alerting:</b> A component of an action that comes before the rest signaling there is an action coming to decode. This alert should have high contrast to the background.</li>
                <br/>Natural selection would favor transmitters that garner better responses, and receivers that have responses that raise their fitness. But there are chances for foul play to happen. The transmitter could use actions that only increase the transmitters fitness. Deceit or bluffing is also possible. Bluffing could be done by sending false signals to the receiving creature. It can also occur the opposite direction with the receiver giving a false response to the true signal.</p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Scent</h4>
        <span>
            <p>In EvolveTD there are currently four kinds of scent. Food scent, creature scent, creature's reproductive scent, and creature's pain scent. All food have the same scent but the scent in creatures is evolved. First it is determined if each creature can produce a scent, if they can produce a scent then they will produce a scent. Reproductive scent and pain scent are harder for the creature to evolve. Not only does the creature have to have the ability to produce scent, they have to evolve the ability to create either a reproductive or pain scent. And then those scents will only be used in certain circumstances. For example the creatures will only emit a reproductive scent when they are ready to reproduce, and emit a pain scent when they sense pain.<br/>
                <br/>The strength of their scent is also evolved. Each creature can have one of four levels of strength.  All evolved scent traits come from the genome from the traitScent as follows:<br/><br/>
                <li class="list">Ability to produce scent is determined by the sum of the values in traitScent.</li>
                <li class="list">Ability to emit reproductive scent is determined by the sum of the first five values in traitScent.</li>
                <li class="list">Ability to emit pain scent is determined by the sum of the last five values in traitScent.</li>
                <li class="list">Scent strength is determined by the average of all the values in traitScent.</li></p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Drawing Scent</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Currently scent is drawn in two different passes in EvolvedTD. All food is done in one pass and the creatures scent is done in another pass. Right now this is still slow and needs to be optimized to allow scent to be visible all the time and not just for debugging.  You can enable scent visualization in game by pressing the 'N' on your keyboard.</p>
