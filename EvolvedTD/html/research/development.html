        <h2>Overview of Development</h2>
        <span>
            <p>All organisms start from something much smaller than they are now, for example the adult organisms that you see every day have all gone through the process called development to become what you observe. For sexually reproducing organisms, development starts when two haploid gametes, one gamete per parent, come together and form a diploid cell called a zygote. This process is fertilization and it is the first step of the developmental process for many animal species. From here, the zygote will divide numerous times creating copies of itself that will eventually form the embryo. The formation of the embryo is embryogenesis and while there are a vast variety of embryonic types that form, there is a commonality to the process shared throughout the animal kingdom. While an organism is an embryo its skeletal structure, organs, nervous system and everything else it will need to survive in life is built from millions of continuously dividing cells. It is important for us to have a good understanding of how the organisms around us have come into being, and how they can continue to change throughout their lifespans. Development does not stop after embryogenesis; just like how once you were born you did not stay a baby. You, like all other organisms, started to grow larger and would eventually reach adulthood. </p>

        <h4>Overview of Morphology</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Understanding how all the individual parts of an organism come together and function as one is the study of morphology. By comparing the morphological makeup of organisms to one another, it is possible to find relationships that link them together. A great example of this is comparing the limbs of organisms and the purposes that they serve. These structural relationships are classified as either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar developmental process, structural pattern and function, while analogous structures only share a similar function. Differentiation of relationships such as these allows us to classify organisms and organize them by similarities. It must be noted that morphology can be split into different areas of study. Anatomy is the study of organs and organisms as a whole. Histology is the study of the structure and arrangement of tissues. Cytology is the study of cells and their features. Embryology is the study of embryos and their developmental patterns.</p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Development and Morphology</h2>
        <h4>Senescence (The Round Counter)</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Senescence is the gradual deterioration of function that is observed in most living organisms. Currently, all members of the Protean Swarm do not suffer any negative effects from aging throughout gameplay, although the creatures are killed at the end of each wave.  Now, this does not mean that senescence cannot or will not be implemented in the future if desired by the teams or required for gameplay reasons. It would be possible to create a system of aging for the swarm modeled after mammalian senescence. However, as the swarm is in its current state, the lack of senescence is reminiscent of the aging effects observed in the class ''Reptilia''. Reptiles, unlike mammals, tend to show few signs of aging, have long lifespans, and lack an increase in mortality rate tied to age. This evolutionary divergence in aging between mammals and reptiles could work as justification for the current model of age, but so could lack of a real senescence model for the sack of gameplay.</p>

        <h4>Regeneration and Repair</h4>

Development is responsible for the production of the organs and tissues that make up our bodies. During embryogenesis, cells divide rapidly and differentiate to form different structures throughout the entire body. Organs and tissues are produced from specialized cells that will be responsible for providing continued functionality all throughout life. But what happens when these cells are damaged beyond the point of functionality? This is where regeneration comes into play. Regeneration in its most simple terms is the reactivation of the developmental processes that took place during embryogenesis to form the organs, tissues, or limbs that are now damaged. The levels of regenerative capacity exhibited by organisms vary, but almost all organisms are capable of at least basic regeneration. An amazing example of regenerative capability is that of the axolotl, an amphibian capable of regenerating entirely lost limbs and other structures. The Protean Swarm does not yet have a regenerative capacity able to match that of the axolotl, mainly due to not yet having limbs, but it does currently possess a basic level of regeneration. Imagine that you are cutting vegetables with a knife and you slip and cut your thumb. Your body registers that it has been injured and immediately begins the healing process. Now, you do not need to create a new thumb to regain full use of your digit, but you do need to restore it enough that it can function like it once did. This simpler form of regeneration is what we would refer to as healing. Healing generally happens in a few main phases: clotting phase, inflammation phase, proliferative phase, maturation phase. For more detail check out the wiki [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing]. This process takes energy from the body, though it would be hard to notice when just healing a cut on your thumb. The Protean Swarm is capable of healing damage that they take, provided that they have the time and energy to do so. Just like in real life, the healing that the swarm is capable of at this level will be limited by more than just the amount of energy they have to spare. When we heal cuts scars are left behind because it is an imperfect form of regeneration, dubbed repair. To simulate this, once a member of the swarm takes damage and heals it will have less maximum life to represent the effects of the wound.

        <h4>Morphological Plasticity</h4>

Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to produce multiple phenotypes from one genotype. This ability is influenced by the environmental factors that the organism interacts with such as temperature, population size, nutrition, terrain, and age. Immobile organisms are prone to value phenotypic plasticity more than mobile organisms because of their inability to move away from unfavorable environments. Plants exhibit a wide range of plasticity that many animals cannot match, however there are animals capable of amazing plasticity. An example of this is ''Acyrthosiphon pisum'' of the Aphid family, which exhibits the ability to interchange between asexual and sexual reproduction, as well as growing wings between generations when plants become too populated [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826372/].
[PhenotypicPlasticitybyChuckFox.jpg|Phenotypic Plasticity]</p>
            <p>What makes plasticity possible is the fact that the genotype does not produce an organism that is set to only one ideal form. The genotype is capable of producing changes when influence by outside sources but these changes in phenotype are not simply reversible. An organism that is plastic is capable of crossing reaction norms when in certain environments or situations. A reaction norm is the expression of a particular phenotype by a single genotype. The change in phenotype does not have to be morphological, as it can also be the adaptation of new behavioral patterns, though in the case of the Protean Swarm it is starting as a morphological change. Specifically, members of the swarm will have changing color patterns determined by their level of nutrition, the terrain that they presently reside on, and their age. Age will eventually affect the swarm twofold, both with energy cost to power the plasticity and ability to change repeatedly. Limitations such as the long lag-time of most morphological changes and the maintenance of sensory and regulatory mechanisms of plasticity will be ignored for now. In nature, these costs and limitations associated with plasticity can influence an organisms overall fitness either positively or negatively. The current model will work under the assumption that the swarm possess such an incredible level of adaptability that these limits have been surpassed, at least for now.

        <h2>Computational Model of Development and Morphology</h2>
        <h4>Creature Age</h4>
        <span>
            <p>The age of the creature is tracked through a timestep counter.  The timestep counter increases with each timestep, which in simpler terms is every time a screen update is made.  This value is used in calculating creature color, fitness and health regeneration.</p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Health Regeneration</h4>
        <span>
            <p>When a creature picks up food it gains energy from the food.  Some of this energy gets designated to health regen to be used when the creature takes damage.  The creature gradually transforms energy to health over time until it runs out of energy for regeneration.<br/>
                <br/>To do this, each timestep we first check if the creature has enough regeneration energy stored up and if its current health is less than its maximum health.  If these checks pass then we increase the creature health by the regen value and decrease the energy available by the cost to regen health.</p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Coloration</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Based on a number of inputs such as fitness, health, energy, etc. the creatures color will change.  To do this we use a network that recieves all the various affecting factors as inputs and calculates a RGB value for each section of the creature.  With this, creatures could evolve to blend in with their environment.</p>
