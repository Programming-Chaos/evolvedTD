        <h2>Overview of Genetics</h2>
        <span>
            <p>All living things start with the hereditary molecules called DNA. This is short for deoxyribose nucleic acid. There are four types of these nucleic acids and arrange themselves into a very long stretch of code that determines every characteristic of any organism, often referred to as bases. This arrangement creates a structure called a chromosome which is comprised of
two strands of linked nucleic acids that are complimentary and anti-parallel.<br/>                  
                <br/>Genetics involves the changing and interpretation of these double-strands of code. There are two basic models of this: Quantitative and Mendelian <br/>
                <br/>All the traits of every living thing can be changed by mutations. These are simply changes to the code, whether it be one nucleic acid or numerous. These changes can drastically change how an organism looks (its phenotype), or not at all. </p>

        <h4>Quantitative Genetics</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Quantitative genetics, which is the more common method of how traits work, is the idea that traits arise from multiple genes and alleles, and these are all sort of summed up into a value on a scale of how much the trait is expressed. For instance, if foot size can range from 1-10, all your genes or alleles can add up to give you a foot size of 5.0, 7.3, 8.4, etc.</p>

        <h4>Mendelian Genetics</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Mendelian genetics deals with dominance of traits. A trait is a specific characteristic of an organism, such as if pea seeds will be round or shriveled up. If a trait is dominant, the trait will be expressed in the individual, but if a trait is recessive, this trait will only be expressed if it has two copies of the recessive trait on the double-stranded code.</p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Genetics</h2>
        <span>
            <p>In EvolveTD, each individual functions as a diploid organism. This means that it has a set of two chromosomes from which each trait for the individual is drawn from. Each chromosome contains a gene that has a trait value randomly selected. The combination of both trait values from each chromosome gives the overall value of each trait for the creature, but this value varies depends on the trait. For example, if one trait, or allele, has a value of 3 for body segments, and the other allele has a value of 2, the sum of 5 means that the individual will have 5 body segments. <br/>
                <br/>Part of these chromosomes, just as in the real world, is non-coding "traits." This is just dead code in the genome that is there simply for mutation drawing. This makes it less likely for mutation to affect an actual trait, in fact a lot of our DNA is non-coding.  Mutation occurs when the code of the genome changes from what would be normal. In this game, that means that the average trait value varies from its original drawn value by a significant amount. This causes the new individual to look quite different or function different than the parent organisms. </p>

        <h2>Computational Model of Metabolism</h2>
        <h4>Framework</h4>
        <span>
            <p>In code, this model is abstracted into a Genome class, with an accompanying Trait class and Chromosome class. On each instantiation of the Trait class, a number of genes is added to the Genome, and the index of the start of those genes is saved into the Trait; in this way, named instances of Trait provide access to each trait's specific sublist of genes (in both chromosomes) and the sum of those genes (which is the most common value used in the expression of a trait's set of genes into the trait's phenotype).</p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Genome</h4>
        <span>
            <p>The Genome holds two instances of a Chromsome, named xChromosome and yChromosome (note: these are not the biological meaning of X and Y chromosomes; the names simply indicate two individual chromosomes forming a pair). On instantiation, each Chromosome initializes an array of floating point values, the size of which was previously calculated in the instantiations of the creature's traits. (In this way, no math nor magic numbers are used; indices and sizes are calculated automatically.) Each floating point value in each Chromosome array is initially given a random value drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a configurable standard deviation, currently 0.05 (pretty close, but not quite, zero).</p>
        </span>
        
        <h4>Reproduction Use</h4>
        <span>
            <p>For reproduction, a creature's Genome has a getGametes() function which takes the creatures pair of chromosomes (the gametes), performs a naive implementation of two-point crossover, and then mutates each gene of each gamete with at a configurable rate (currently 5%) by a configurable amount (currently a random value from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.3). These recombined and mutated gametes are then returned for placement in the reproduction team's gamete pool.<br/>
                <br/>It should be noted that traits also include a configurable amount on dead i.e. non-encoding genes trailing the trait's encoding genes in the genome. Currently this is set at an extra 1/3; so a Trait with 10 encoding genes will have an additional 3 non-encoding genes. It has been found that dead genes help mitigate the destructive effects of crossover (at least, in genetic programming).</p>
