        <h2>Overview of Genetics</h2>
        <span>
            <p>All living things start with the hereditary molecules called DNA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA]. This is short for deoxyribose nucleic acid. There are four types of these nucleic acids and arrange themselves into a very long stretch of code that determines every characteristic of any organism, often referred to as bases. This arrangement creates a structure called a chromosome which is comprised of
two strands of linked nucleic acids that are complimentary and anti-parallel.                       <p>Genetics involves the changing and interpretation of these double-strands of code. There are two basic models of this: Quantitative [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics] and Mendelian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance]</p>
            <p>All the traits of every living thing can be changed by mutations. These are simply changes to the code, whether it be one nucleic acid or numerous. These changes can drastically change how an organism looks (its phenotype), or not at all. </p>

        <h4>Quantitative Genetics</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Quantitative genetics, which is the more common method of how traits work, is the idea that traits arise from multiple genes and alleles, and these are all sort of summed up into a value on a scale of how much the trait is expressed. For instance, if foot size can range from 1-10, all your genes or alleles can add up to give you a foot size of 5.0, 7.3, 8.4, etc.</p>

        <h4>Mendelian Genetics</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Mendelian genetics deals with dominance of traits. A trait is a specific characteristic of an organism, such as if pea seeds will be round or shriveled up. If a trait is dominant, the trait will be expressed in the individual, but if a trait is recessive, this trait will only be expressed if it has two copies of the recessive trait on the double-stranded code.</p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Genetics</h2>
        <span>
            <p>In EvolveTD, each individual functions as a diploid organism. This means that it has a set of two chromosomes from which each trait for the individual is drawn from. Each chromosome contains a gene that has a trait value randomly selected. The combination of both trait values from each chromosome gives the overall value of each trait for the creature, but this value varies depends on the trait. For example, if one trait, or allele, has a value of 3 for body segments, and the other allele has a value of 2, the sum of 5 means that the individual will have 5 body segments. </p>
            <p>Part of these chromosomes, just as in the real world, is non-coding "traits." This is just dead code in the genome that is there simply for mutation drawing. This makes it less likely for mutation to affect an actual trait, in fact a lot of our DNA is non-coding.  Mutation occurs when the code of the genome changes from what would be normal. In this game, that means that the average trait value varies from its original drawn value by a significant amount. This causes the new individual to look quite different or function different than the parent organisms. </p>
