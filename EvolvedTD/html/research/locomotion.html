        <h2>Overview of Locomotion</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Locomotion is the ability to move from one place to another.  This can be for any organism across any terrain.  Locomotion is usually accomplished by specialized structures specifically for movement. These structures can take the shape of legs, fins, tentacles, or even thousands of hair- like structures. While some organisms have adapted to be more suited in a single environment, there are some that have found ways to traverse different environments. <br/>
                <br/>Locomotion in most cases requires energy to produce movement. The more mass an organism has the more energy that it will take to move it. The energy is required for the appendages to propel the organism across the terrain.  The only way that you can have movement without cost to the organism is when the terrain is doing the work for the organism. Examples of passive movement would be rolling down a hill or floating down a river. The downside to this kind of movement is the organism no longer has control of its direction. </p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Locomotion</h2>
        <span>
            <p>The current model for locomotion for the protean swarm is similar to the Starfish. Under the creatures are thousands of little legs that move the creature along. As the creature evolves appendages it gains the capacity to improve movement in different environments. For instance if the creature evolves and gains fins, it will be able to maneuver through water with greater ease compared to a creature accustomed to only land. The appendages may also help the creatures navigate around objects placed by the player, such as walls, rocks, and defense towers.<br/><br/><br/></p>
