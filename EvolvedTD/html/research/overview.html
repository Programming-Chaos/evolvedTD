        <h2>Modeling An Evolutionary System</h2>
        <span>
            <p>In order to model an evolutionary system, one must first research and understand the affecting entities within that syste.  In EvolveTD we wanted to create an environment where the enemy not only adapted to it's surroundings, but also could learn and formulate optimal decisions for survival.  Much like in nature, these learned behaviors would need to be passed on to the next generation in order to evolve the behaviors further.<br/>
            <br/>By reading the various topics presented on this page, you will learn much about the complexity of such a system model.  Each topic gives a breif biological description of the topic followed by an explanation of how this system works inside of EvolveTD.  The topic will then describe the computational model for the topic's implementation.  The last section in each topic will contain a section with references for extended research and a link to the topic's EvolveTD wiki page in case you would like a more detailed description of the topic.</p>

        <h2>Experimenting with EvolveTD</h2>
        <span>
            <p>We highly recommend using EvolveTD for experimenting with evolution while having fun.  It is a great system for people from middle school, high school and up.  While you're reading through the various topics here, if you find something that interests you, create and experiment!  Write up a hypothesis and play the game to test that hypothesis or play it to see what it takes to make your hypothesis true.  If you need help creating an experiment or coming up with an idea, check out our <a href="html/experiments.html">Experiments</a> page.  We have created several experiments for you to start with!</p>
