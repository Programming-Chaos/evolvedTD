        <h2>Overview of Senses</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Interactions between an organism and the environment are brought about in a series of steps:<br/><br/>
            <li class="numbered">To begin, the environment acts on the organism creating a change or difference for the creature.</li>
            <li class="numbered">Second The organism is able to tell there is a difference or sense a change by using particular special part of its body that provides information about one type of possible change.</li>
                <li class="numbered">Third the organism acts upon that change in some way, and how it acts is determined by its brain or innate behavior.</li></p>

        <h4>Receptors</h4>

            <p>Receptors are the particular special parts of a creature’s body that react to a certain type of change that then sends that information to the brain. Receptors are usually very small--one cell big in fact-- but they work together with receptors near them to make what is called a Sensory System.<br/>
                <br/>What limits how many things we can see, hear, feel, taste, and smell is controlled by what receptors we have, what our receptors CAN find differences in, how well they can sense the amount of difference, and how much difference they can measure. <br/>
                <br/>We need to look at the restrictions of our receptor, however. Most rulers are hard, rigid, and straight. So with a straight hard ruler, we can tell how wide a ball is, but can't measure the ball's circumference. If we had a tailor's ruler, printed on flexible fabric, then we could measure the circumference. So even though they both measure length, we use tailor's ruler for different lengths than a regular ruler.<br/>
                <br/>Our body does this for vibrations: Our ears measure sound vibrations, and our skin measures vibrations of solid objects.  The saying that something is best for something and worst for something else applies nicely. <br/>
                <br/>Receptors can react too many different things: light, vibration (on the skin or sounds in the air), temperature, damage to the body, chemicals in the air (smell) or dissolved in liquids (taste). And there are some parts of light or frequencies of sound that our bodies cannot detect, because the receptors aren't tuned for that specific stimuli. </p>

        <h2>Biological Model of Senses</h2>
        <h4>Senses</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Senses are manifested by a part of the nervous system responsible for incoming information. Each sense (sight, smell, touch, taste, sound) is handled by a different sensory system. These systems are parts of the nervous system that package and send incoming information to the brain. One sensory system is made up of many receptors, a nervous tissue pathway, and a part of the brain dedicated to processing that sense’s information. Here, we are going to focus on the first part of this: the receptors. <br/>
                <br/>In nature, sensory systems measure four different aspects of stimulus: type, intensity, duration, and location. Many receptor cells use proteins on their surface or inside them to sense their stimulus. These proteins interact with a specific stimulus and change in shape to tell the receptor cell its type of stimulus is present.<br/>
                <br/>Any one receptor cell can have many proteins within or on it, so as a cell has more stimulus around it, more of the proteins will change shape. This allows the receptor to measure how intense the stimulus is by looking at how many proteins are in one shape at one time, up to a certain point.<br/>
                <br/>When all of a cell’s proteins are interacting with stimulus, even if more stimulus comes in, there are no proteins open to change shape. The receptor cell tells the brain that it is receiving a strong signal by sending electrical pulses through the nervous system very quickly when many of its proteins are in the changed shape conformation and sending pulses slowly when most of its sensing proteins are in their natural shape. This frequency of signal sent tells the brain the intensity of the stimulation.

        <h4>Nervous system</h4>
        <span>
            <p>To measure the duration of stimulation, a sensory cell simply continues reporting to the brain as long as it has proteins that are changed in shape. As long as the proteins are folded differently, there is stimulus, and the receptor cell continues to send electrical pulses to the brain that there is stimulus.<br/>
                <br/>A sensory system tells the brain location in a funny, but simple, way. Information going into the brain from the senses is physically moved through nerves. Nerves are like electrical wires, and each wire goes to a specific part of the brain. Because of the structural nature of this, the brain learns stimulation across its own location to be associated with specific body parts. <br/>
                <br/>The part of the brain that processes incoming information is called the somatosensory cortex, and it looks like one long wrinkly strip about half-way back across the top of the brain (if you are looking down from the top).  When a brain is cut in coronal sections (from right to left instead of front to back) if you look at this somatosensory cortex strip you can “see” the physical location where senses are processed in the brain. When location of incoming information is labeled along this part of the brain it shows a map of incoming information to the body.

        <h2>Simplifying Assumptions</h2>
        <span>
            <p>In the protean swarm, each creature is made up of a number of specific possible parts. Because the body is made up of finite defined pieces, many receptors are confined to measure one section of the body. Those that are measuring the outside environment, such as smell, are also confined to one per specialized body part structure. This replaces the physical information movement of the nerves by allowing us to associate information in an array, with a specific numbered part of the body.<br/>
                <br/>Another simplification is that each individual sense uses the fewest amount of receptors "cells" as is possible to get the effect of having the sense. There is one pain receptor for each body segment, while one "segment" in nature has millions of receptors. <br/>
                <br/>We are also not using proteins as sensors for cells as receptors for nerves to send information to the brain. In this model our receptor is able to get information from the environment without a physical change. <br/>
                <br/>We are also simplifying the specificity of some systems. In nature, smell is an interaction between the space and shape of smelling molecules and receptor proteins, like a puzzle. In nature there is an infinite number of molecule shapes and receptor protein fits and each is unique. To simplify this for computing purposes, we have modeled smell on nature's taste: giving each object different magnitudes of four to five characteristics which altogether made the smell/flavor of that object. This allows things to smell similar in some ways, perhaps disguising poisonous foods, but different in other ways, allowing those creatures who are predisposed to evolve to be able to differentiate them.</p>

        <h2>Computational Model of Metabolism</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Sensory systems have been overly simplified in order to keep computational complexity down.  In our model we use the following traits because they contribute to the overall fitness of the creatures.<br/><br/>
                <li class="list">Pain</li>
                <li class="list">Pressure</li>
                <li class="list">Smell</li>
                <li class="list">Taste</li>
                <li class="list">Speed</li><br/>
                <br/>Pain contains three components, current amount of pain, pain threshold, and pain dampening. Pain threshold is the amount of pain that can be felt by the creature. Pain dampening is the percentage of pain that depreciates over time.<br/>
                <br/>Pressure also comes in three forms:<br/><br/>
                <li class="list">Pressure of touch from the environment around the creature.</li>
                <li class="list">Pressure from the ground underneath the creature.</li>
                <li class="list">Pressure from other objects such as other creatures, rocks and the tower felt by the creature.</li>

                <br/>Smell is gathered by usage of antennae, which samples the enviroment around the creature (such as a ant would) to gather the smell that is located there.<br/>
                <br/>Taste can either be sampled from the antennae, or tasted once the food is eaten.<br/>
                <br/>Speed is just sampled from the body to tell the creature how fast the creature is currently moving.</p>
