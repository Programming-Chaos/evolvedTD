        <h2>Overview of Speciation and Diversity</h2>
        <span>
            <p><img src="images/Speciation_Models.gif" align="right" style="width:15em"/>In the biological sense of the term, speciation refers to the process by which a single type of organism diversifies into multiple different types of organisms. The best defined criteria for classifying species is the inability of the organisms to interbreed which is known as reproductive isolation.<br/>
                <br/>For a group of organisms to diversify into multiple species, some means of segregating the population into groups must exist. One way of classifying these modes of speciation is to segregate them by their geographic properties, and in this type of classification, the different modes are called allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation. The mechanisms of reproductive isolation responsible for the inability of the groups to interbreed can also be classified into groups, which include temporal, geographic, behavioral, mechanical and gametic isolation. Finally, there are a variety of models used by scientists to explain the causes of speciation, as can be seen by this figure. </p>

        <h4>Reproductive Isolation</h4>
        <span>
            <li><b>Temporal and Gepgraphic Isolation:</b>
                <br/>Temporal isolation, where the members of different species are either active or reproductively viable at different times, and geographic isolation, where members of different species are separated by distance or natural barriers, together comprise the most basic form of segregation between species. Both of these forms of isolation cause the different species to not be present during the mating times of the other species, which prevents transfer of genetic material between the groups. This lack of genetic transfer can accentuate the genetic differences among the groups. Geographic isolation in particular is frequently the first type of isolation to occur, and can often lead to other types over the passage of time.</li>

            <li><b>Behavioral Isolation:</b>
                <br/>Behavioral isolation refers to the differences in the mating rituals of separate species. These behavioral differences lead members of the separate species to not view each other as viable mates, which prevents them from interbreeding. This is a less common method of initial speciation since a single group of organisms is unlikely to spontaneously develop different mating behaviors as that would limit them from breeding with perfectly viable mates who are not difficult to come in contact with.</li>

            <li><b>Mechanical Isolation:</b>
                <br/>Mechanical isolation occurs when the sexual organs of two different species are incompatible, which acts as a physical barrier to the completion of mating. Mechanical isolation is typically indicative of a large degree of underlying genetic difference, since the body structure of an organism is controlled genetically. It is also unlikely to be the initial method of speciation for the same reasons as behavioral isolation.</li>

            <li><b>Gametic Isolation:</b>
                <br/>Gametic isolation occurs when the gametes of two organisms are incapable of fertilizing each other, which prevents the creation of viable offspring. This is the final pre-zygotic form of reproductive isolation and, similar to behavioral and mechanical isolation, unlikely to be the initial method of reproductive isolation.</li>

        <h4>Geographic Modes of Speciation</h4>
        <span>
            <li><b>Allopatry and Peripatry:</b>
                <br/>Allopatric speciation occurs when two populations of a single species become separated geographically, creating a physical barrier to reproduction. Over time, the two populations may drift far enough apart genetically, due to the lack of interbreeding, that they become incapable of interbreeding even if they later come into contact. The initial form of reproductive isolation observed here is geographic isolation, which then often leads to the other forms of reproductive isolation.<br/>
                <br/>Peripatry is a subtype of allopatric speciation and occurs when a small group of the initial species enters a new ecological niche and becomes geographically isolated because of it. Allopatric speciation resulting in geographic isolation can also result in sympatric speciation if the two populations come back into contact, particularly if the time the populations have spent apart has resulted in one or more visible trait differences. </li>
  
            <li><b>Parapatry:</b>
                <br/>Parapatric speciation refers to when two groups of a single species arise that are largely separated geographically, with only a small area of contact between the two groups, where interbreeding can occur. The small scope of the contacting area can lead to the proliferation of genetic differences between the populations with the small amount of gene transfer due to interbreeding being insufficient to allow the differences to spread evenly between the groups. Over time, this can lead to the individuals in either group becoming incapable of interbreeding through non-geographic forms of reproductive isolation, which then causes the complete elimination of the already limited gene transfer between them.</li>
            
            <li><b>Sympatry:</b>
                <br/>Sympatric speciation is the diversification of a single population into multiple species without any form of geographic isolation preventing interbreeding. This is the most contentious form of speciation, since for a long time it was difficult to show how a group of organisms could diverge into separate species in the presence of unrestricted gene flow between them. Nevertheless, evidence for the existence of this form of speciation makes its existence difficult to doubt, even if the mechanisms behind it remain difficult to clarify.</li>
