        <h2>Overview of Terrain</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Terrain is the part of the environment that you see on the ground, such as the rocks, plants, rivers and lakes. In order for organisms to survive in any particular environment they must evolve to be better suited for that specific environment, and the terrain specifically can impact the overall expression of traits such as speed, size and armor.<br/>
                <br/>This is possible because the organisms with traits better suited to that environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those desirable traits to their offspring. There should be, in most cases, no specific traits that are desirable in every terrain. Different terrains require different traits for an optimal chance at survival. These different types of terrain are a significant part of the larger biome, a community of organisms adapted to a climate or environment on a large geographic area.  Examples of such are better described below in the biology of terrain in EvolveTD section.<br/>
                <br/>Terrain is also part of the dynamic ecosystem that combines both climate and terrain. For example the water cycle has many effects on the terrain and the climate. Terrain has a direct effect on the evolution of a particular organism. In this game it affects the evolution of the Protean Swarm so it is important for the player to understand how and why the terrain does this so that they too can survive.

        <h2>Biological Model of Terrain</h2>
        <h4>Water Cycle</h4>
        <span>
            <p><img src="images/Water-Cycle.png" align="right" style="width:16em"/>The continuous movement of water from climate to terrain is called the water cycle, which turns out to be very important. It is made up of many components, but the main ones that are relevant to the game are precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and condensation.<br/>
                <br/>For starters, precipitation is water released from clouds, or in other words, how the water gets from the atmosphere (climate) to the terrain. The water from the clouds can come in many forms such as rain, snow, and hail.  For example, as a result of rain or snow melt-off moving downwards through the force of gravity, we get the process of runoff.  In other words it is the force that draws the water down to the surface of the planet. In the game if the water is not on a flat surface of the terrain it will runoff or flow to a lower area of the terrain. This is important for lakes and rivers since it keeps them full, and they can even expand depending on the size of the storm. <br/>
                <br/>The next step is evaporation.  Evaporation is when the water on the ground changes from a liquid to a gas. This returns the water to the atmosphere in the form of water vapor.  When this is implemented in the game the lakes and runoff puddles will decrease after it stops raining and the temperature rises, thus simulating evaporation.<br/>
                <br/>After evaporation comes condensation, the last step of the water cycle.  It is when the gas or vapor water returns to its liquid state. It is seen as the clouds in the sky, representing the compression of water molecules to a more compact form. Once the clouds are full with water, precipitation will begin again.<br/>
                <br/>While there are some things missing in our version of the water cycle we have been able to simulate some of the main components described above so that the effect of the water cycle can be taken into account when the evolution of The Protean Swarm is analyzed. Since the water cycle directly adds and takes away water from the environment it should directly influence the creature’s locomotion.

        <h4>Biomes</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Biomes are classified by the predominant vegetation and the types of adaptations of organisms to that environment. Since our current 
            biome is currently not similar enough to the five major biomes on Earth (Forests, Tundra, Aquatic, Desert, and Grasslands) it is a new type of biome. The only type of vegetation currently in our biome is grass which does not seem to hinder the Protean swarm in any way.<br/>
                <br/>The main obstacle for the Protean swarm in this biome are rocks or lakes. There are a variety of rocks varying in shape and size, and some areas have more rocks than others. The rocks either hinder the movement of the Protean swarm or keep them from getting food that lies underneath, but can also block shots from the tower, protecting the creatures behind them.<br/>
                <br/>Like all organisms, The Protean Swarm must adapt to this terrain to survive. The main differences in evolutionary adaptations of the organisms can be observed in the rocky versus the grass terrains, meaning different traits are needed to be successful in these two terrains.<img src="images/Biome_triangle.jpg" align="right" style="width:15em; margin-top:0.5em"/><br/>
                <br/>Rocks and grass are not the only parts of the terrain in these biomes, though. The available biomes can also be composed of lakes that slow down The Protean Swarm, which may also eventually affect their evolution. Like the rocks, the lakes vary in size and shape. Each of these additions to the new biome directly affects The Protean Swarm, and affects the species evolution.</p>

        <h4>Ecosystems</h4>
        <span>
            <p>An Ecosystem is a smaller component that makes up the biome, and is defined as a community of living and non-living things that work together.  In this biome there are currently four different ecosystems. They are the grass terrain, rock terrain, lakes terrain and snow terrain. The living components of EvolveTD are The Protean Swarm and the player.  The Protean swarm will eventually adapt to whatever ecosystem they are mostly in, showing the relationship between the living and non-living parts of the ecosystem. It is the non-living things that will be different from the very beginning.<br/>
                <br/><img src="images/Ecoregions.jpg" align="right" style="width:13em"/>For example, the grass terrain is the simplest one for The Protean Swarm to navigate and around in with very few obstacles.  There are still rocks, but in the grass terrain, the rocks are spaced out so there is room for The Protean Swarm to move freely. The rock terrain is composed of areas where the rocks are closely clustered together so it is more difficult for The Protean Swarm to move.<br/>
                <br/>The lakes are another ecosystem that doesn't completely hinder The Protean swarm but can significantly slow them down. They are ecosystems that are completely made up of water with no other non-living components such as rocks or trees. Each of the 2 above ecosystems will affect the evolution of The Protean Swarm in different ways since different traits will be optimal for their survival. Currently speed of locomotion is the main difference for living organisms in these different ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Computational Model of Terrain</h2>
        <h4>Simulating Terrain</h4>
        <span>
            <p>Our model for randomly generating terrain uses an algorithm known as Perlin noise generation.  This allows us to create a single, random function wave.  We then apply this function wave to three directions; up/down, left/right, forward/backward, also known as x, y, and z.  Once applied we can extract a 3D "map".  With this 3D map applied to our terrain we can use altitude ranges to determine where to draw land, water and mountains.<br/>
                <br/>To visually represent our 3D map we apply a corresponding height value to each tile on our map in the range of 0 to 1.  i.e. our lowest tiles will be closer to 0 and the highest tiles will be closer to 1.  From these values we can decide that a tile below a certain height is water and therefore drawn as blue.  We can even say that the further below that threshold a tile is, the darker the color of blue.  The same can be applied to land and mountains.  Currently the height thresholds in the game consist of water at the lower heights, mountains at the heigher altitudes and land somewhere in between.</p>

        <h4>Simulating the Water Cycle</h4>
        <span>
            <p>In future versions of the game we would like to add some form of water cycle.  This would simulate plant absortion and evaporation as well as growing and shrinking bodies of water.<br/>
                <br/>To implement this we would keep track of how much water is on the ground vs absorbed or evaporated.  Then we could increase or decrease the threshold height for water appropriately then re-calculate and redraw the map.  Hotter temperatures would increase evaporation rate and rain would increase the amount of water on the ground.</p>
