Hey everyone, to run this script you will need RStudios on.

Once R studio is open - open up this .Rnw (Sweave) document.

run the command in R
> setwd("<CURRENT DIRECTORY WITH SWEAVE DOCUMENT>")

This sets the working directory to have the correct location of the data folders.

After that just click compile near the top of the sweave document. 

Most common form of mistake is no data folder or data folder does not have data in it.
